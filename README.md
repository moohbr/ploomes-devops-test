# Brasileir√£o API / Ploomes DevOps test

The main intention of this repository is to show knowledge about how to deploy an application on Docker.

## ü§ù Used API

The trial version of the [API FUTEBOL](https://www.api-futebol.com.br/documentacao). The table don't correspond to reality!


## ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING

The .env files are only here, compiled, with the real value of the variables, as there was no way to pass the data to the evaluator. This should NEVER be done in production/real environments.
